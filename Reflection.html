            and what was learned throughout the year.

            Intro to software technology teaches a lot of 
            different programming languages like C, JavaScript,
            and Assembly. We also learned about bootstrap and
            simple web design.

            HTML is used to create websites. We learned many
            different tags to use in our HTML websites like 
            the nav tag, which is used to navigate through 
            different HTML pages that are linked together by the href tag.
        </p>

            When we learned JavaScript the unit mainly focused
            around math and creting and using variables. We learned how 
            to write JavaScript code that would ask for user input 
            as well as using the code to preform basic math problems.
